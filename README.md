## RedditPosterBot (WIP)
A Discord bot combining the features of Pycord and
PRAW to send posts from a specified subreddit and a
specified amount of posts into any channel, all at
the send of a slash command.

Missing a lot of features, more to come (probably).

## Features
* Mostly stuff that's just functionality of PRAW
  * Self posts
  * Images, gifs, and videos (probably)

## Planned things
* `while` loops and not just `for` loops with a
working break command (will most likely never work)
* Created date that isn't in Unix time.
